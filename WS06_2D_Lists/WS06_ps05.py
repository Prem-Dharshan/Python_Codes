"""5. Write a function to multiply two matrices. The header of the function is: 
def multiplyMatrix(A, B) 
To multiply matrix A by matrix B, the number of columns in A must be the 
same as the number of rows in B, and the two matrices must have elements of 
the same or compatible types. Let c be the result of the multiplication. Assume 
the column size of matrix A is n. Each element Cij is ai1 * b1j + ai2 * b2j + â€¦ 
+ain * bnj. For example, for two matrices A and B, C is 
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two matrices and displays 
their product."""
