"""1. Chris owns an auto repair business and has several employees. If any employee works over
40 hours in a week, he pays them 1.5 times their regular hourly pay rate for all hours over 40.
Design a simple payroll program that calculates an employeeâ€™s gross pay, including any
overtime wages.
You design the following algorithm:
Get the number of hours worked.
Get the hourly pay rate.
If the employee worked more than 40 hours:
Calculate and display the gross pay with overtime.
Else:
Calculate and display the gross pay as usual."""

                        f"Gross pay is {time*pay}")
