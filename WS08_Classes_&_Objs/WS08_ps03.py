"""3. Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employeeâ€™s hourly pay rate, number
of hours worked, and total pay for the week. Write a program with five PayRoll objects.
The program should ask the user for the number of hours each employee has worked and
will then display the amount of gross pay each has earned. Input Validation: Do not accept
values greater than 60 for the number of hours worked"""
